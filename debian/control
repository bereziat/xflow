Description: Image processing software
 Xflow is an utility devoted to display image 2D vector fields in a GTK
 window. Image vectors fields are embedded in an Inrimage image data.
 Xflow can display simultaneous several vector fields (in order to
 compare them), and produce postscript figures or mpeg/avi sequences
 for report or multimedia presentations.
